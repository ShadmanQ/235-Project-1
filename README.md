## Word Jumble

#### Rules: 
    - the player receives a scrambled word, they must guess the word to win the round
    - they have three tries to guess the word
    - If the player wins the round, they receive a new more difficult word at the start of the round
    - The player has the option has to swap out the word, up to five times in a single game session. This is a lifeline.
